Market Sentiment Impact on Trader Performance – Summary
Methodology

Two datasets were used: one containing market sentiment (Fear and Greed Index) and another containing detailed trader activity.
After cleaning and converting timestamps to daily format, both datasets were merged by date.
Key metrics such as daily profit and loss, trade frequency, win rate, trade size, and trade direction were created.
Exploratory data analysis and visualizations were used to compare performance across different sentiment conditions.
Traders were also grouped into segments based on risk level, trading frequency, and consistency.

Insights

Fear periods showed the highest trading activity and profitability

Greed periods had lower win rates and weaker performance

Traders placed larger trades during Extreme Greed

Infrequent traders often earned higher profits than frequent traders

High-risk traders performed well in Fear and Greed but poorly in Extreme Greed

Overall, market sentiment clearly influenced both behavior and results.

Strategy Recommendations

Reduce risk and position size during Extreme Greed periods

Focus on fewer high-quality trades instead of overtrading

Use Fear periods as opportunity phases while applying strong risk control

Adapting strategies based on market mood can improve performance and reduce losses.

--> Limitations

The analysis was limited by the number of overlapping dates between sentiment and trading data.
Additional market factors such as volatility and price trends were not included.

--> Future Scope

Using longer time periods, adding technical indicators, and building predictive models can provide deeper insights.
